<b>Why is it that this question is so rare?</b> </br></br>

It's not right when the sun is dark.
It's not cold near fire burning bark.
Perhaps the silent scream of the wood, is because of the shadow cast by the good.
You may think this poem to be dull.
But why don't you have a go?
Within this fiction a true picture is painted.
One not quite so dilapidated.

Within this picutre whereever set, in the forest or at home.
One thing is certain, whithin imagination you're not alone.
